Sirop d'érable, or maple syrup, is a pure and natural sweetener made from the sap of maple trees. This syrup is known for its rich, caramel-like flavor and amber color. Sirop d'érable is commonly used in breakfast dishes like pancakes, waffles, and French toast, as well as in baking and cooking. It can also be drizzled over yogurt, ice cream, or fruits for a sweet and flavorful treat. Rich in antioxidants and minerals, maple syrup is a healthy and delicious alternative to refined sugars.
