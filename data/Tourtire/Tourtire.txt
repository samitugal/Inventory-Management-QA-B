Tourtière is a traditional Canadian meat pie, particularly popular in Quebec. It is made with a mixture of ground pork, beef, or veal, seasoned with spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. The filling is encased in a flaky pastry crust, creating a hearty and flavorful dish. Tourtière is often enjoyed during the holiday season, especially at Christmas and New Year's Eve celebrations. It can be served with a side of ketchup, chutney, or a simple green salad. Tourtière represents the rich culinary traditions of French-Canadian cuisine.
