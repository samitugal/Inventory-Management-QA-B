Ikura, also known as salmon roe, is a delicacy in Japanese cuisine. These bright orange pearls are prized for their briny and slightly sweet flavor, as well as their pop-in-your-mouth texture. Commonly used as a topping for sushi, sashimi, and rice bowls, Ikura adds a touch of luxury and visual appeal to dishes. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, it also offers nutritional benefits. Whether enjoyed on its own or as a garnish, Ikura brings a taste of the ocean to your plate, making it a favorite among seafood enthusiasts.
